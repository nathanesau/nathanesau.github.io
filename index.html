<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I <a href="https://github.com/nathanesau" class="user-mention">@nathanesau</a> study Actuarial Science at Simon Fraser University. I began my degree there in Fall 2012 and plan to graduate in April 2017. </p>

<p>This website summarizes the various projects I've worked on, whether it be through school, case competitions, co-op placements or contributing to existing GitHub repositories. For some of these projects I can't provide many details, but for those which I have permission to do so, I've given an overview of what I did and shared relevant files.</p>

</h4>

<ul>
<li>This case competition had a "Property and Casualty Insurance" theme to it</li>
<li>Our team played the role of a hypothetical consulting firm "GoStats". Our client "Ontario University" was planning to replace their automobile fleet and wanted to know whether they should install safety features in their vehicles</li>
<li>To answer this question, we looked at a variety of safety features, including (but not limited to) computerized collision avoidance technology, passenger side airbags and parking assistant technology. We analyzed both the financial and non-financial of each of these safety features</li>
<li>To analyze the financial impact, we projected future losses using loss development factors and looked at the return on investment for various combinations of safety features</li>
<li>Finally, we also analyzed whether our client who self insure or use third party insurance </li>
</ul>

</h4>

<ul>
<li>In September 2015, Simon Fraser University held a <a href="http://people.stat.sfu.ca/%7Edac5/CaseStudy2015/Welcome.html">case competition</a> in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Simon Fraser University</li>
<li>We were given a dataset for a <a href="http://uken.com/">Uken</a> mobile app game and asked to predict how much time a player spent playing the game, how much money they spent on in-app purchases and whether they would continue to play the game a month after installing it</li>
<li>In the dataset, we had demographic information about users (i.e. country they were  from, gender, etc.) and also event information (i.e. did they complete level 1, did they send a gift to another user, etc.)</li>
<li>We used machine techniques to predict the target variables - a random forest model was used to predict how much money a player spent and how much time they spent playing the game, and a gradient boosted logistic regression model was used to predict the target variables. This was my first exposure to data science.</li>
