## About My YouTube Channel

I never did finish all 25 [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges. But 13/25 is a decent start. My Repo is [here](https://github.com/nathanesau/advent_of_code_2020).

I decided to film youtube videos for first 9 solutions. It seems that my [Graph Solution for Day 7](https://youtu.be/FPKAS6vX1O4) was the most popular. I kind of liked my [Sudoku Python Video](https://youtu.be/4uUQToFVUYA) but it didn't gain much traction.

Also I created cool a AoC 2015 Java template [here](https://github.com/nathanesau/advent_of_code_2015).

At some point, I plan to make more YouTube videos. It's fun.
