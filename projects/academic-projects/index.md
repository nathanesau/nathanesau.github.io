## [Academic projects](/projects/academic-projects)

Most of my academic projects were done using R. Here is a list of the projects available on [github.com/nathanesau-academic](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic).

### Course Projects

* [whistlerweather](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/whistlerweather) Analysis of Whistler, BC weather data from 2006 to 2014, part of my Stat300W course in Fall 2015.
* [lmodels](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/lmodels) Functions related to SOA Exam C, some code I wrote during my actuarial science courses in school.
* [acma490project](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/acma490project) My project related to stochastic analysis of insurance portfolios. I was very proud of the final result of this project - all the results in the report are easily re-producible using my ``Stocins`` package and the report is well-formatted in Latex and to the point.
* [pensionproject](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/pensionproject) A project related to valuation of pension plans (included writing a detailed actuarial valuation report in Latex).
* [lifeinsuranceproject](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/lifeinsuranceproject/) Calculate expected present values for endowment insurance product and write report.
* [nhlmodel](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/nhlmodel/) Using linear regression model in hockey context.

### Co-op Projects

* [coord](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/coord) Sample coordination in R (i.e. related to survey statistics).
* [StocVal](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/StocVal) Stochastic Valuation of Embedded options in pension plans, part of my Summer 2015 research project.

### Case Competitions

(From Wikipedia) In a case competition, participants strive to develop the best solution to a business or education-related case study within an allocated time frame, typically with teams of two or more individuals pitted against each other in a head-to-head or broader relative ranking.

* [ukencompetition](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/ukencompetition) Simon Fraser University Data Science Competition from Summer 2015.
* [Asna2016](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/Asna2016) Actuarial Students National Association 2016 Competition related to analyzing the cost effectiveness of automobile safety features.

### Comments

I liked to use Latex a lot in university, so you can find many examples of beamer presentations, reports, and assignments written in Latex in the repositories above. In particular, I really liked R sweave which allows R results to be directly incorporated into a PDF. My usual workflow would be to create an R package with my code, and type up my assignment in Sweave as a ``.Rnw`` file. In the Sweave file, I would load the library of my package and call a few functions to produce the numbers for my assignment.

For R, the package system is really good. I especially like being able to use ``?function_name`` to look up documentation. For my R code, I have tried to document all my functions so you can see what each of the parameters mean and see examples of how to use each of the functions. I also like being able to use ``apply`` functions when I am programming in R and manipulating data frames... so much easier to do that kind of like in R compared with C++!

### Miscalleneous

Other repositories on my academic github:

* [acma490](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/acma490) The time series material in this course was very interesting. I have some codde I wrote in this repository.
* [stat485](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/stat485) More code related to time series.
* [acma395](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/acma395) Code related to SOA Exam C.
* [acma320](https://github.com/nathanesau-academic/acma320) Code related to SOA Exam MLC.
