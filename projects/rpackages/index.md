## [R packages](/projects/rpackages)

The packages I have worked on are listed below:

* [makehams](/projects/rpackages/makehams) Code for SOA Exam MLC, "Models for Life Contingencies" with focus on survival models such as Makeham's Law.
* [MSM](/projects/rpackages/MSM) Code for SOA Exam MLC, "Models for Life Contingencies" with focus on multiple state models.
* [m4fe](/projects/rpackages/m4fe) Code for SOA Exam MFE, "Models for Financial Economics".
* [stocins](/projects/rpackages/stocins) Code to analyze stochastic behavior of insurance portfolios.

## Installing R packages

The R packages can be installed using the ``devtools`` package. For example,

```{bash}
devtools::install_github("nathanesau/m4fe")
```
