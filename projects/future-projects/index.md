## [Future Projects](/projects/future-projects)

Here is a list of my future project ideas:

### Electron app

Electron is a framework for creating Desktop applications using NodeJs.

Here is a simple application I created to try out electron [electron-tictactoe](https://github.com/nathanesau-tutorials/electron-tictactoe). Note that I also created the same program using Tkinter [tkinter-tictactoe](https://github.com/nathanesau-tutorials/tkinter-tictactoe) when I was looking into which Python GUI framework to use. I ended up going with PyQt :P.

### D3.js app (recharts)

I am interested in creating a website to show interactive data visualizations. The idea would be to scrape some data from a website (for example, WalkScore website based on location) and show the data in interactive graph format. [gdqstats](https://gdqstat.us/?series=0) is an example of what I would like to achieve. The simple example I have made so far is [here](https://github.com/nathanesau-tutorials/lifetables).
