### FantasyTennis

<a href="https://github.com/nathanesau/FantasyTennis"><img src="../../../assets/images/github-button-blue.png" width="250"/></a>

I worked on this project during the 2019 US Open. The program is a bracket viewer for men's tennis which allows user to download bracket info from ATP website and make predictions about matches. This way, the user can see what the potential matchups will be in future rounds.

A screenshot of the project is shown below:

### Technology Stack

The project was made using Python and PyQt5. For webscraping, I used the ``bs4`` (i.e. BeautifulSoup) package.
