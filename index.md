### About Me

I @nathanesau study Actuarial Science at Simon Fraser University. I began my degree there in Fall 2012 and plan to graduate in April 2017. 

This website summarizes the various projects I've worked on, whether it be through school, case competitions, co-op placements or contributing to existing GitHub repositories. For some of these projects I can't provide many details, but for those which I have permission to do so, I've given an overview of what I did and shared relevant files.

### Case Competitions

#### [2016 Actuarial Students National Association Case Competition](https://nathanesau.github.io/Asna2016/)

* This case competition had a "Property and Casualty Insurance" theme to it
* Our team played the role of a hypothetical consulting firm "GoStats". Our client "Ontario University" was planning to replace their automobile fleet and wanted to know whether they should install safety features in their vehicles
* To answer this question, we looked at a variety of safety features, including (but not limited to) computerized collision avoidance technology, passenger side airbags and parking assistant technology. We analyzed both the financial and non-financial of each of these safety features
* To analyze the financial impact, we projected future losses using loss development factors and looked at the return on investment for various combinations of safety features
* Finally, we also analyzed whether our client who self insure or use third party insurance 

#### [2015 Statistical Case Competition at Simon Fraser University](https://nathanesau.github.io/ukencompetition/)

* In September 2015, Simon Fraser University held a [case competition](http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~dac5/CaseStudy2015/Welcome.html) in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Simon Fraser University
* We were given a dataset for a [Uken](http://uken.com/) mobile app game and asked to predict how much time a player spent playing the game, how much money they spent on in-app purchases and whether they would continue to play the game a month after installing it
* In the dataset, we had demographic information about users (i.e. country they were  from, gender, etc.) and also event information (i.e. did they complete level 1, did they send a gift to another user, etc.)
* We used machine techniques to predict the target variables - a random forest model was used to predict how much money a player spent and how much time they spent playing the game, and a gradient boosted logistic regression model was used to predict the target variables. This was my first exposure to data science.
