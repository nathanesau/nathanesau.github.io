I began my degree there in Fall 2012 and plan to graduate in April 2017. \r\n\r\nThis website summarizes the various projects I've worked on, whether it be through school, case competitions, co-op placements or contributing to existing GitHub repositories. For some of these projects I can't provide many details, but for those which I have permission to do so, I've given an overview of what I did and shared relevant files.\r\n\r\n### Case Competitions\r\n\r\n#### [2015 Statistical Case Competition at Simon Fraser University](https://nathanesau.github.io/ukencompetition/)\r\n\r\n* In September 2015, Simon Fraser University held a [case competition](http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~dac5/CaseStudy2015/Welcome.html) in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Simon Fraser University\r\n* We were given a dataset for a [Uken](http://uken.com/) mobile app game and asked to predict how much time a player spent playing the game, how much money they spent on in-app purchases and whether they would continue to play the game a month after installing it\r\n* In the dataset, we had demographic information about users (i.e. country they were  from, gender, etc.) and also event information (i.e. did they complete level 1, did they send a gift to another user, etc.)\r\n* We used a random forest model and gradient boosted logistic regression model to predict the target variables and ended up getting first place out of the 7 teams involved \r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
