I began my degree there in Fall 2012 and plan to graduate in April 2017. \r\n\r\nThis website summarizes the various projects I've worked on, whether it be through school, case competitions, co-op placements or contributing to existing GitHub repositories. For some of these projects I can't provide many details, but for those which I have permission to do so, I've given an overview of what I did and shared relevant files.\r\n\r\n### Case Competitions\r\n\r\n#### [2016 Actuarial Students National Association]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### [2015 Statistical Case Competition at Simon Fraser University](https://nathanesau.github.io/ukencompetition/)\r\n\r\n* In September 2015, Simon Fraser University held a [case competition](http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~dac5/CaseStudy2015/Welcome.html) in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Simon Fraser University\r\n* We were given a dataset for a [Uken](http://uken.com/) mobile app game and asked to predict how much time a player spent playing the game, how much money they spent on in-app purchases and whether they would continue to play the game a month after installing it\r\n* In the dataset, we had demographic information about users (i.e. country they were  from, gender, etc.) and also event information (i.e. did they complete level 1, did they send a gift to another user, etc.)\r\n* We used machine techniques to predict the target variables - a random forest model was used to predict how much money a player spent and how much time they spent playing the game, and a gradient boosted logistic regression model was used to predict the target variables. This was my first exposure to data science.",
